# run processes script with the following inputs:
# 1) path to the folder with the stitched radargram.npy and x and y coordinates.npy
# 2) path to the output folder
# 3) Isurf_thresh: integer index number with the maximum index (depth in pixels) of the surface return (e.g., 200)
# 4) wtmm_scale: spatial scale to run the wavelet transform [in pixels] (e.g., 1000)
# 5) size_thresh: minimum length threshold to filter the wavelet output traces [in pixels] (e.g., 200)
# 6) mod_thresh_multiplier: minimum modulus value as a fraction of the mean throughout the image (e.g., 1 = mean, 1.5 = 150% of the mean, 0.8 = 80% of the mean)
